		      	<p><i>This essay was published in <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/story/where-are-you-from/" target="_blank">North by Northwestern</a>.</i></p>

		      	<p>“Shanghai, China,” I answered cheerfully whenever someone asked me where I’m from during orientation. It was the most natural answer – I lived in the same city, the same apartment for 15 years. I don’t know another home.</p>

		      	<p>When people know your origin, they form certain expectations about you. I, however, did not grow up in the same culture as most other Chinese international students who were born and raised in the country. My family holds American passports. I spoke English throughout high school and among friends. I can rarely join in the rapid-fire conversations peppered with slang between other students from China, and rarely do I feel at home among them.</p>

		      	<p>“I’m from Shanghai, but I was born in the Bay Area,” I started to tell people, hinting that I’m not as culturally distant as they might otherwise imagine. I’ve been to the Bay Area a few times since my family moved away when I was three. I have relatives there. If I have a second home, that must be it.</p>

		      	<p>On the other hand, my answer reminds me of the pregnant Chinese women who travel to California to give birth to U.S. citizens. These children then grow up in China without much contact with American culture. Unlike them, I am the child of immigrants. My parents’ story, in addition to the American education that I received, forms a significant part of my cultural identity. America is more to me than merely a birthplace.</p>

		      	<p>“I’m originally from California, but I grew up in Shanghai.” I changed my answer once again during the Chinese Student Association social, feeling particularly self-conscious due to how “American” everyone seemed. (The organization is divided into “dynasties,” which sounds very Chinese until one realizes they’re dynasties from Avatar: The Last Airbender.) My answer was in no way false. I am originally from California. I did grow up in Shanghai. Why, then, do I feel dishonest? My accent is American enough for me to pass as “just another Chinese American from California,” and I suppose my new answer gives that impression.</p>

		      	<p>So where am I really from? The truth is, for me, this question is irrelevant. People are not defined by their geographic locations, past or present. I have friends who went to school in the U.S. but remain more in touch with their Chinese background than I do. I also know people who spent nearly all their life in China but remain ignorant of the culture around them. Instead, my cultural identity is shaped by the people and ideas surrounding me. I associated myself with Chinese culture a lot more five years ago, before transferring to an American international school in Shanghai. Then, the texts that I read and the friends that I made added American elements to my identity. At college, I have an even bigger pool of cultural environments to choose from – I even started learning German!</p>

		      	<p>My father likes to talk about roots. “At the end of the day, you are Chinese,” he declares. I disagree. At the end of the day, I am whoever I want to be. I just have to find out who that is.</p>

		      	<p>I video call my mother late at night<br>

				evokes late evenings, walking by her side<br>
				in the cool breeze, after a warm day. <br>
				Sometimes the boundless water that divides  <br>
				us doesn’t really feel like such a long way. <br>
				Her voice breaks. “Would you mind repeating that?” <br>
				I asked her when the crackling fades. <br>
				And when I try to joke about our cat, <br>
				her laugh arrives, just a moment late. <br>
				“No battery left!” And then the screen went black. <br>
				I wish her face would somehow flicker back.<br></p>

		      	<p>Let me begin by addressing my achievements in the pillar of scholarship. I am very smart, smarter than almost everyone else in my grade; that’s why I belong in NHS. I also work very hard. I have a 4.0. Some people ask me, why do you work so hard? Well, I enjoy smiling smugly when I tell people that I have a 4.0, like I am doing right now. </p>
		      	<p>Scholarship is very important to me, but my outstanding achievements don’t stop there. Did I mention that I’m in nine clubs and a sports team? I am an exec for five of them, too. Look at this, I am pure leadership material. Everyone wants me to lead (that is, until I got elected and stopped being responsible). But it’s the title that matters, right? It’s fine to ditch a meeting or two here and there... or all of the meetings... As long as I don’t lose my position, I can still reference them when I talk about what a great leader I am. On the downside, you probably haven’t heard of any of these clubs because they are practically nonexistent—except on my resume. </p>
		      	<p>Of my nine clubs, most of them are service-related because I’m a selfless altruist. (Look at my use of the word “altruist;” it’s proof of my outstanding scholarship.) This aspect of my character makes me fit the NHS ideal of service. I am joining NHS out of my love of serving others. It means nothing to me that NHS is a prestigious-sounding club that looks terrific on my college apps. I’m not sure what NHS does, but you should admit me because I love to serve.</p>
		      	<p>You may also notice that I am very ambitious from my outstanding achievements in scholarship and leadership. One day, I want to graduate from a top-notch college, earn lots of money, and spend my days climbing the corporate ladder. NHS’s structure echoes my elitist values, and joining this organization is my first noble step in life. </p>
		      	<p>Thank you for considering me as an applicant. After you have read this application, I am sure you have realized that it is not I who need you, but it is you who need me.</p>
